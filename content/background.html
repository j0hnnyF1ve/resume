<p>"I don't invent things, I make things better!"</p>
<p>I have been working as a web developer for over 4 years with an emphasis on cutting edge, front-end technologies. </p>
<p>With the advent of Web 2.0 and Ajax type technologies, I have devoted the better part of my career to finding out how to use and leverage these technologies in order to deliver better applications and more intuitive user interfaces for users. </p>
<p>My objective is to find an innovative company or organization who needs a front end developer that can take them to the next level.</p>
<p>More recently, I’ve also been learning more about PPC (Pay per Click) and SEO Marketing, in order to help broaden the application of my current technical skills.</p>
